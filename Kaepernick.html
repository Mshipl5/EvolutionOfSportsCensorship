Colin Kaepernick is a former NFL quarterback who used his platform to shed light on the injustices happening in America.  On August 26, 2016, Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee during the national anthem instead of standing with everyone else.
This sparked a large controversy and outraged many people.  Colin exercising his right to freedom of expression ultimately led to his indefinite suspension from the NFL.  After Colin's suspension, many other athletes took a kneel during the anthem to show their solidarity and to let Kaepernick know that he is not alone.
Kaepernick then sued NFL owners for collusion and recieved around $10 million from the NFL.  Even though Kaepernick won his case, he has yet to be signed with an NFL team.
