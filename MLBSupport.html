<p> 
The MLB as well as many other sports leagues showed solidarity for the racial injustice in the U.S.  
The NY Mets and the Marlins were scheduled to play against each other in August of 2020 but instead they used the spotlight for a greater cause.
Both teams stood up and removed their hats at the beginning of the game and shared a moment of silence for the victims of police brutality.
Following the moment of silence, both teams left the field and did not play the game.  
Unlike the NBA and NFL, the MLB is not African American dominated, so for them to take time out to stand for the BLM movement was inspirational.
