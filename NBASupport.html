The NBA is one of the largest sports leagues in the world and players used this platform to shed light on the racial injustices that have been going on for years.  
The murders of George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, both unarmed citizens murdered by police, sparked the protest.
Players from every NBA team came together in solidarity.
They wore shirts and jerseys with slogans like "Say Their Names" & "Black Lives Matter" to show their support for the BLM movement.
Even the court was decorated with "Black Lives Matter" which shows that not only the players were protesting but the entire league as an organization.
Games were even post-poned in response to the murders.  
As you can see, players can now freely express their political views without the threat of losing their job or career.  
Instead they are embraced by the organization.
