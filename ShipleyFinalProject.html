	<div class = "box box6"> In the past, athletes were not able to share their views or feelings towards political issues without repercussion.  By following the image links, you will be taken on a journey on how far professional athletes have come in the past few years when it comes to their political views.  Athletes have gone from being scared to speak out because of the fear of losing their job or following.  With the recent events that occurred in 2020 regarding police brutality, specifically towards African Americans, we have watched athletes across all sports come together to fight against injustice.  Each image will go more in detail about situations that athletes have dealt with so that you can get a firsthand look on how far censorship in sports have come. </div>
