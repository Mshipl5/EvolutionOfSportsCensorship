Fox News anchor, Laura Ingraham called out Lebron James and Kevin Durant for their remarks on Donald Trump.
Since Lebron James and Kevin Durant are NBA players, she downplayed their political views and uderestimated their profession.  
She stated that they get paid millions to simply dribble a ball even though the sport of basketball is way more complex than just dribbling a ball.
She went on to call out Lebron James for going straight to the NBA instead of college as a reason for his political views not to be respected.  
She also showed that her commentary was race driven when backed Drew Brees, a white professional athlete, when he stated his views about Donald Trump.  
Many celebrities have requested that Laura should lose her job because of her controversial statements but she still works for Fox until this day.
